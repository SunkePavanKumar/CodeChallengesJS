An Algorithm is the set of instructions that needs to be executed to get the fruitful result

It is set  of well defined instruction to execute a problem

properties
==============
Well defined inputs and outputs


How do we measure an algorithm?

Time Complexity : Amount time taken be an algorithm to execute the problem.

Big O notation for the wrost time complexity
Big omega for best complexity
theta for the average time complexity


space complexity : Amount of space it takes to execute the task.
